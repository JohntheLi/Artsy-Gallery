# Artsy-Gallery
iOS app created during 2017 Blueprint hackathon that uses the Artsy API to show an art gallery. Still WIP

This is a work in progress iOS application that enables a user to browse a custom-tailored artwork gallery. This app uses the Artsy API to retrieve images from a database, and then allows the user to rate the image.
